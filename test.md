# Task to be implemented.

Build a fuzzer that uses the simulator's execution feedback to generate inputs that maximize code coverage for a given contract. This is a critical tool for finding edge cases and potential panics in complex smart contract logic before deployment.

# README File

Erst By Hintents
Erst is a premium developer toolset for the Stellar network, designed to provide high-fidelity "glass-box" debugging and simulation for Soroban smart contracts.

Status: Active Development (Phase 4: Advanced Diagnostics) Documentation: https://dotandev-hintents-75.mintlify.app/ Focus: High-Fidelity Simulation, Auth Tracing, and Security Auditing

Scope & Objective
The primary goal of erst is to eliminate the opaque "black box" experience of failed Stellar smart contract transactions. By providing local-first, high-fidelity replay and tracing, erst maps generic network errors back to human-readable diagnostic events and source code.

Core Features (Planned):

Transaction Replay: Fetch a failed transaction's envelope and ledger state from an RPC provider.
Local Simulation: Re-execute the transaction logically in a local environment.
Trace decoding: Map execution steps and failures back to readable instructions or Rust source lines.
Source Mapping: Map WASM instruction failures to specific Rust source code lines using debug symbols.
GitHub Source Links: Automatically generate clickable GitHub links to source code locations in traces (when in a Git repository).
Error Suggestions: Heuristic-based engine that suggests potential fixes for common Soroban errors.
Usage (MVP)
Debugging a Transaction
Fetches a transaction envelope from the Stellar Public network and prints its XDR size (Simulation pending).

./erst debug <transaction-hash> --network testnet
Debug an offline envelope from stdin (no RPC):

./erst debug < tx.xdr
Interactive Trace Viewer
Launch an interactive terminal UI to explore transaction execution traces with search functionality.

./erst debug <transaction-hash> --interactive
# or
./erst debug <transaction-hash> -i
Features:

Search: Press / to search through traces (contract IDs, functions, errors)
Help overlay: Press ? or h to see all keyboard shortcuts
Tree Navigation: Expand/collapse nodes, navigate with arrow keys
Syntax Highlighting: Color-coded contract IDs, functions, and errors
Fast Navigation: Jump between search matches with n/N
Match Counter: See "Match 2 of 5" status while searching
See internal/trace/README.md for detailed documentation.

Performance Profiling
Generate interactive flamegraphs to visualize CPU and memory consumption during contract execution:

./erst debug --profile <transaction-hash>
This generates an interactive HTML file (<tx-hash>.flamegraph.html) with:

Hover tooltips showing frame details (function name, duration, percentage)
Click-to-zoom to focus on specific call stacks
Search/highlight to find frames by name
Dark mode support that adapts to your system theme
Export Formats:

# Interactive HTML (default)
./erst debug --profile --profile-format html <transaction-hash>

# Raw SVG with dark mode support
./erst debug --profile --profile-format svg <transaction-hash>
See docs/INTERACTIVE_FLAMEGRAPH.md for detailed documentation and docs/examples/sample_flamegraph.html for a live demo.

Audit log signing (software / HSM)
erst includes a small utility command to generate a deterministic, signed audit log from a JSON payload.

Software signing (Ed25519 private key)
Provide a PKCS#8 PEM Ed25519 private key via env or CLI:

Env: ERST_AUDIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM
CLI: --software-private-key <pem>
Example:

node dist/index.js audit:sign \
  --payload '{"input":{},"state":{},"events":[],"timestamp":"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"}' \
  --software-private-key "$(cat ./ed25519-private-key.pem)"
PKCS#11 HSM signing
Select the PKCS#11 provider with --hsm-provider pkcs11 and configure the module/token/key via env vars.

Required env vars:

ERST_PKCS11_MODULE (path to the PKCS#11 module .so)
ERST_PKCS11_PIN
ERST_PKCS11_KEY_LABEL or ERST_PKCS11_KEY_ID (hex)
ERST_PKCS11_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM (SPKI PEM public key for verification/audit metadata)
Optional:

ERST_PKCS11_SLOT (numeric index into the slot list)
ERST_PKCS11_TOKEN_LABEL
ERST_PKCS11_PIV_SLOT (YubiKey PIV slot such as 9a, 9c, 9d, 9e, 82-95, f9)
Example:

export ERST_PKCS11_MODULE=/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so
export ERST_PKCS11_PIN=1234
export ERST_PKCS11_KEY_LABEL=erst-audit-ed25519
export ERST_PKCS11_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM="$(cat ./ed25519-public-key-spki.pem)"

node dist/index.js audit:sign \
  --hsm-provider pkcs11 \
  --payload '{"input":{},"state":{},"events":[],"timestamp":"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"}'
The command prints the signed audit log JSON to stdout so it can be redirected to a file.

For YubiKey PIV (YKCS11) usage details, see docs/pkcs11-yubikey.md.

Protocol Handler
Erst registers a custom erst:// URI scheme, allowing external tools (browsers, dashboards) to deep-link directly into a debug session.

Register the protocol handler:

./erst protocol:register
Open a debug session via URI:

./erst protocol:handle "erst://debug/<transaction-hash>?network=testnet"
With an optional operation index:

./erst protocol:handle "erst://debug/<transaction-hash>?network=mainnet&op=0"
Unregister the handler when no longer needed:

./erst protocol:unregister

Technical Analysis
The Challenge
Stellar's soroban-env-host executes WASM. When it traps (crashes), the specific reason is often sanitized or lost in the XDR result to keep the ledger size small.

The Solution Architecture
erst operates by:

Fetching Data: Using the Stellar RPC to get the TransactionEnvelope and LedgerFootprint (read/write set) for the block where the tx failed.
Simulation Environment: A Rust binary (erst-sim) that integrates with soroban-env-host to replay transactions.
Execution: Feeding the inputs into the VM and capturing diagnostic_events.
For a detailed explanation of the architecture, see docs/architecture.md.
